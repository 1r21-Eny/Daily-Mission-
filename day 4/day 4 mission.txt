🧠 Daily Challenge: “Odd One Out”

Goal: Build a small program that filters words by a hidden rule.

🧩 Task:

Ask the user to enter a list of words (separated by spaces).

Then, remove and print only the words that meet a hidden rule:

The rule: The word must have an odd number of vowels.

Output both lists —

✅ “Words with an odd number of vowels”

🚫 “Words with an even number of vowels”

Example:
Enter words: apple pear kiwi banana orange
✅ Odd vowels: ['apple', 'banana']
🚫 Even vowels: ['pear', 'kiwi', 'orange']

🧩 Bonus (if you finish early):

Ignore capitalisation (so “Apple” = “apple”).

Add a mode where the user can type a custom rule (like “length > 4”).

Try writing a one-line version using list comprehensions.
