ðŸ§® Option 2: Simple Calculator with Memory
Make a text-based calculator that can:

Add, subtract, multiply, divide.

Save the last answer as a variable (e.g. ans) you can reuse in the next calculation.

Example:

> 5 + 5  
10  
> ans * 3  
30


Bonus: Add error handling for invalid input or division by zero.
