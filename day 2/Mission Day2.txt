🧭 Day 2 — “Cipher Crafter”

Mission:
Create a Caesar Cipher encoder and decoder.

Your program must:

Ask the user for a message and a shift number (1–25).

Encode the message by shifting each letter forward in the alphabet (wrap around after Z).

Ignore case when encoding, but preserve whether letters were uppercase or lowercase.

Keep spaces, punctuation, and digits unchanged.

Offer to decode the message back to its original form using the same shift.

Bonus challenge:

Detect invalid input (like non-integer shifts).

Allow the user to input either “encode” or “decode” and do the right thing automatically.
